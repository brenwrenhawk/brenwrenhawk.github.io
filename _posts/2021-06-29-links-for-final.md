These allegations come after questions to a semester checkpoint test have been found on “Brainly,” [a
homework helper website.](https://www.brainly.com) No investigation has been open into the allegations yet.

According to a study from the International Journal for Educational Integrity, [cheating during the
pandemic has likely increased with the help of homework helpers.](https://edintegrity.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1007/s40979-021-00070-0)

Brainly’s honor code, [which can be read here](https://brainly.com/honor-code), says that students are “never allowed to post questions
directly from tests, quizzes, and assessments, or copy answers found on Brainly during tests, quizzes,
and assessments.”

Teachers, like Siañez, are now advocating for better access to testing software to help alleviate testing
issues. One program is “Respondus Lockdown Browser,” [a web browser that prohibits access to other
desktop apps until the test is finished](https://web.respondus.com/he/lockdownbrowser/).

Full interviews with both teachers can be found on [brenwrenhawk.github.io](https://brenwrenhawk.github.io).
