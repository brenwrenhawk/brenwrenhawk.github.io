**Teachers complaining of homework helpers used to cheat during remote learning**

_By: Brenden Malacara – July 2nd, 2021_

El Paso, Texas – El Dorado High School teachers are now raising concerns after new allegations of cheating during remote learning have come to light.

These allegations come after questions to a semester checkpoint test have been found on “Brainly,” [a homework helper website.](https://www.brainly.com) No investigation has been open into the allegations yet.

“I think that schools should lock down these sites,” said Andrea Segura, a history teacher at El Dorado. “Cheating doesn't give us an accurate look at their progress.”

According to a study from the International Journal for Educational Integrity, [cheating during the pandemic has likely increased with the help of homework helpers.](https://edintegrity.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1007/s40979-021-00070-0)

“The data shows a substantial increase in the number of questions asked and answered in the period from April 2020 onwards,” the study reads. “Given the number of exam style questions, it appears highly likely that students are using this site as an easy way to breach academic integrity by obtaining outside help.”

During remote exam proctoring, teachers started to speculate that students were taking advantage of remote learning as a way to cheat.

Donna Siañez, a dual credit speech instructor, said “It is evident when answers provided by students do not correspond to their usual vernacular or writing.”

“However,” she warned, “sometimes it is difficult for an educator to be able to confirm the act of cheating.”

Brainly’s honor code, [which can be read here,](https://brainly.com/honor-code) says that students are “never allowed to post questions directly from tests, quizzes, and assessments, or copy answers found on Brainly during tests, quizzes, and assessments.”

“It's a little upsetting for students to use these websites to solicit answers on a live test because students may not realize it,” Segura said, “but educators use their achievements to help direct their instruction.

“If a student cheats, we don't know how to shift our instructions to clear-up misunderstandings.”

Teachers, like Siañez, are now advocating for better access to testing software to help alleviate testing issues. One program is “Respondus Lockdown Browser,” [a web browser that prohibits access to other desktop apps until the test is finished.](https://web.respondus.com/he/lockdownbrowser/)

“I feel the best way for schools to go about to cease these operations is to have programs such as Respondus implemented.” She stated. “Just like colleges have instilled for many years, clear disciplinary actions should be set in place for academic dishonestly.”
