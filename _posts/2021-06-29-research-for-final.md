title: Final Interviews - Siañez
---
This is the interview I conducted via email with Mrs. Donna Siañez.

Here were the questions:
* Have you used/heard these homework helpers? If so, how have you used them?
* Do you believe the pandemic has made cheating more accessible?
* How would you feel if your students did use these websites to solicit answers from a live test?
* How should the school go about to cease these operations?

This email conversation was from Mrs. Donna Siañez, a dual credit speech instructor at El Dorado.

**Have you used/heard these homework helpers? If so, how have you used them?**
Yes, I have heard of homework helpers through students. No, I have not used them before because I encourage my students to use their own textbook to find answers to their questions. I ask for text evidence to support their answers. In addition, I prefer to have discussions on the content in order to find different perspectives and for students to share their findings.

**Do you believe the pandemic has made cheating more accessible?**
Yes, most definitely the pandemic has made cheating more accessible. It is evident when answers provided by students do not correspond to their usual vernacular or writing. It is obvious when students copy and paste answers. However, sometimes it is difficult for an educator to be able to confirm the act of cheating.

**How would you feel if your students did use these websites to solicit answers from a live test?**
It is difficult to hold a student accountable for their learning if we do not have the accessibility for such programs as Respondus with a lock down browser which requires for students to use a camera and disables internet access when taking a test. When possible, I use plagiarism apps embedded within the system to determine whether the answers to weekly assignments were copied. I feel "homework helpers" will hinder the students learning.  Sometimes students try to find the easy way out, without learning. In the long run, they hurt themselves. My goal has always been to encourage students to read the text and use their own critical thinking to solve problems. Whenever possible, I try to find and create assignments which require unique/personal responses from students which are supported through textual evidence, therefore, encouraging original work.

**How should the school go about to cease these operations?**
I feel the best way for schools to go about to cease this operations is to have programs such as Respondus implemented.  Just like colleges have instilled for many years, clear disciplinary actions should be set in place for academic dishonestly. However, I do not have an answer for what the disciplinary actions should entail.
