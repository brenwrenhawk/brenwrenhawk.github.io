title: Final Interviews - Segura
---
This is the interview I conducted via email with Mrs. Andrea Segura.

Here were the questions:
* Have you used/heard these homework helpers? If so, how have you used them?
* Do you believe the pandemic has made cheating more accessible?
* How would you feel if your students did use these websites to solicit answers from a live test?
* How should the school go about to cease these operations?

This email conversation was from Mrs. Andrea Segura, an AP Social Studies and History teacher at El Dorado.

**Have you used/heard these homework helpers? If so, how have you used them?**
No, I have never heard of these programs.

**Do you believe the pandemic has made cheating more accessible?**
I do think the pandemic has made cheating more accessible since students are able to share their work via email, or even these "homework helpers." It's also important to note that, if a student is desperate, they'll find a way to cheat anyhow.

**How would you feel if your students did use these websites to solicit answers from a live test?**
It's a little upsetting for students to use these websites to solicit answers on a live test because students may not realize it, but educators use their achievements to help direct their instruction. If a student cheats, we don't know how to shift our instructions to clear-up misunderstandings.  A test result is just as much for a teacher, as it is for a student.

**How should the school go about to cease these operations?**
I schools should lock down these sites. I also think we need to be clear with students that we need actual results to help guide our instruction. Cheating doesn't give us an accurate look at their progress.
